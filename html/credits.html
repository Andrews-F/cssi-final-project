          Hi there. I'm Billy Torres, I was born in Dominican Republic and live in Bergen County, New Jerey. This fall I will begin my crazy college journey at MIT. I'm interested in computer science, business, philosophy, hair and food. Favorite sitcoms include Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and Friends. Thank you to my buddies Larry and Sergey for creating Google. My summer was awesomely productive and full of great food. #CSSI2015

          Hey everyone! My name is Sofie Cornelis and I'm from Manhattan, New York. I will be attending Cornell University in Ithaca, majoring in Information Science and possibly minoring in Food Science. I worked on the Python, HTML, Javascript, and some of the CSS. These past three week at CSSI have been amazing. Thank you to all of the instructors, TA, and the other googlers that helped make this possible.

          My name is Andrews Figueroa and like Billy I too was born in the Dominican Republic. I've lived most of my life in Queens, New York, and I will attending Brandeis University. I plan to major in computer science and engineering, with a possible minor in business. I love design, which is why I worked primarily on the CSS and HTML. This site is a testament of our hard work, and dedication. We hope you enjoy it. (Thank you everyone who helped us reach our goal).
